# About
This is a hobby weekend project I did because I found myself quite often searching through the [Onix codelists](http://www.editeur.org/14/Code-Lists/). The auto-complete search is indexed with codelists and codelist code descriptions and notes. It also has a simple REST API if you need one. I hope you might find this service useful. Feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/lasselehtinen/onix-codelist/issues) if you have some development wishes.</p>

# Live demo
You can find a live version of the app at http://onix-codelists.io
